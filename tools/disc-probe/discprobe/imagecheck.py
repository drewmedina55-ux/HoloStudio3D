"""A look at a finished picture design before it is burned: a small disc at the terminal, and what may surprise.

A burn can't be undone, and a picture on its side, all black or stretched shows at a glance on even a small
disc. Everything here only advises, nothing stops an image being made. The limits are first guesses, kept
wide so a warning means something; a few real discs should settle them. Loaded only after a design is made.
