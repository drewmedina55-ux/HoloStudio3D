"""Which parts of a DVD hold plain random data.

geo needs them. A picture or texture reads at another latency than random data, and the default range
of a disc that holds one (a texture-ring disc, or one with a picture appended) would put rungs on it.
Pictures and textures are written as bytes in the scrambled domain, so undoing the scrambling of a sector
read back gives one or two byte values over and over; random data stays random either way. Unrecorded
or zero-filled sectors (between sessions) are plain before the undoing, so both views must look random.
