"""`timing`: cache/FUA test, CAV/CLV check, and sector phase measurement.

Experiments, in order:
  1. cache  - repeated reads of one sector: plain, with FUA, and after a zero-length
              READ(12)+FUA at the same LBA (redumper's cache flush). A median command
              time under CACHE_HIT_US means the drive answered from its buffer.
  2. period - repeated reads of one sector at inner, middle and outer zones give the
              revolution period there. Equal periods mean CAV; periods growing with
              radius mean CLV, and then the phase method below is not valid.
  3. phase  - alternate a reference sector R and a target X. Under CAV the spindle
              phase advances at a fixed rate whatever the head does, so the phase of
              X's completion relative to R's is the angle between the two sectors on
              the disc (plus a constant decode latency), independent of seek times.
