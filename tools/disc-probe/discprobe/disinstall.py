"""Add an exported preset to DiscImageStudio's user preset file.

DiscImageStudio keeps user presets in %LOCALAPPDATA%\\DiscImageStudio\\disc-presets.json
and reads the file once, at startup. The file is JSON but the app's reader also accepts
comments and trailing commas, so reading here tolerates those too. Writing produces plain
JSON in the shape the app itself saves, keeping the top-level keys and the presets that are
already there.

Only that one file is touched. A preset whose id is already present is left alone when its
values match, refused when they differ (unless --replace is given), and enabled again when
its id sits in the matching disabled list.

Comments and trailing commas are read but not kept: the rewrite is plain JSON, the same shape
the app itself saves. `install` says which of them it dropped so the caller can warn. A
comment that is never closed is refused, and so is writing to the file the export itself is
about to write (that would have eaten the user's presets before they were read).
