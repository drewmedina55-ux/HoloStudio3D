# disc-probe

English | [简体中文](README.md)

disc-probe uses an ordinary optical drive to measure the spiral geometry of a disc, then burns pictures onto the data side of DVD-R or CD-R. You don't need to take photos or mark points by hand.

</p>

*Along the River During the Qingming Festival* on a Ritek F1 DVD-R, straight from the burner. The geometry came entirely from read timing, and the disc was burned once, with no test burn, photo calibration or scan correction. These are phone photos, cropped to the disc and downsized, with the background blurred.

## How it works

To burn a picture on the data side, you need to know the angle at which sector N lands on the disc. Track pitch and bit length differ very slightly from batch to batch. Over tens of thousands of turns that adds up, and the picture twists into a whirlpool. The usual fix is to burn a calibration pattern, photograph it, mark points and correct over several rounds.

disc-probe has the drive measure this instead. On a disc spinning at constant speed, a sector finishes reading at the moment it passes under the head. Read two sectors in turn, convert the difference in completion time to an angle, and you know how far apart they are on the disc. Each reading only gives the angle modulo 360°, so the tool works outward in steps, using the earlier steps to predict the number of whole turns. 22 steps cover a DVD and 36 cover a CD.

The measurement only sends read commands. Its result can go straight into a burnable ISO or be exported as a [DiscImageStudio](https://github.com/JiaFeiMiao-K-Cat/DiscImageStudio) preset.

## Results

### Geometric accuracy

<img src="docs/showcase/grid_lines_zoom.jpg" width="60%" alt="Part of a grid disc scan with straight lines">

This is part of a test grid disc, from a 600 dpi flatbed scan with a high-pass filter, about 38 mm across. This disc also used timing alone and was burned once (HL-DT-ST GH70N, Ritek F1 DVD-R). Eight scans put the rotation error over 25 to 54 mm at 0.11° peak to peak and 0.03° rms. At a 50 mm radius, 0.03° is about 0.03 mm.

<img src="evidence/figures/bending_before_after.png" width="75%" alt="Rotation against radius for three grid discs">

The green line in this plot is that disc. The measurement plan was [registered before the burn](docs/PREREG_remeasure.md) (in Chinese).

### Fine detail

<img src="docs/showcase/dense_motifs.jpg" width="75%" alt="Macro photo of impossible triangles, small figures and line groups along the top">

A macro photo of the dense tiling disc, also burned once. The impossible triangles are 4.2 mm wide and the small figures are 6.8 mm tall. Along the top are groups of three lines for testing line width. The smallest triangle, 1 mm wide with edges of about 0.15 mm, is clearly visible to the naked eye. A 600 dpi scan separates 0.12 mm lines and barely resolves 0.08 mm, which is the scanner's limit.

### Colour (experimental)

Write the same data over and over and that patch of disc acts as a grating, splitting white light. The repeat length decides which colour goes in a given direction, and the colour changes with the angle. This is still an experiment, followed in [#108](https://github.com/JiaFeiMiao-K-Cat/DiscImageStudio/discussions/108).

<img src="docs/showcase/roses_source.jpg" width="42%" alt="The rose picture made with GPT Image"> <img src="docs/showcase/roses_7185.jpg" width="42%" alt="Photo of the burned rose DVD-R, with some petals showing purple">

On the left is the original, made with GPT Image. On the right is a photo of the burned DVD-R, with the background masked. This disc was designed for purple, and from the right angle some petals come close to the original purple, only darker. It only looks right from one angle, the petals change colour when the phone moves, and you can't choose just any colour: purple is the only target so far. Details are in [#168](https://github.com/JiaFeiMiao-K-Cat/DiscImageStudio/discussions/168). The same disc also holds 1.38 GB of data and read back with no errors, see [#170](https://github.com/JiaFeiMiao-K-Cat/DiscImageStudio/discussions/170). These are early results from one disc, and the tool for the rose disc isn't published yet.

<img src="docs/showcase/rosettes_closeup.jpg" width="75%" alt="Petals of one flower showing several colours under a flash">

The one you can burn yourself is this flower disc, with 3 to 4 colours on one flower. We've only burned it on RITEKF1 DVD-R. Measure your disc as in [Quick start](#quick-start), then build the design. This step doesn't touch the drive:

```bash
python tools/compose_rosettes.py
```

It prints the next command, which builds the ISO:

```bash
python -m discprobe image --geo latest --design-npy iso/rosettes_design.npy --textures "MIX:92,87,83,8D,60" A5 92 66 ED00 2AE304 --r-max 57.6 --output iso/rosettes.iso
```

The preview's colours only tell the textures apart, so it won't match the disc. To photograph it, turn off the room lights, use only the phone flash and hold the phone a little to one side. [#108](https://github.com/JiaFeiMiao-K-Cat/DiscImageStudio/discussions/108) has the steps.

### Other drives and discs

- On RITEKF1 discs, our timing result is within about ±0.05° of bczhc's independent photo calibration ([DiscImageStudio #53](https://github.com/JiaFeiMiao-K-Cat/DiscImageStudio/issues/53)).
- A laptop drive about 15 years old (PLDS DS8A8SH, through a SATA-to-USB adapter) measured a geometry about 0.05° rms from our GH70N.
- CMC CD-R takes an extra step, because timing can't tell where the data sits along the track in absolute terms. A burned grid disc sets this constant. On the GH70N it is about 206 frames, and a second disc checked it to within +0.6 frames. The pitch on this batch also has a wave, which left 0.16° rms on the second disc.

## Quick start

> If you exported a preset with `--correction` before 2026-11-06, the correction may not be in it. Update and export again; you don't need to measure again.

You need blank discs from the same batch: at least 2 for DVD (measuring, picture) and at least 3 for CD (measuring, calibration, picture). The measuring disc can't take a picture afterwards, but keep it: other discs of that batch don't need a new one. You also need Windows, Python 3.10 or later and a drive that can burn. For Linux and macOS, see the ports listed under the [table of reports](#drives-with-hands-on-reports). The steps below are for DVD. For CD, see the [CD route](#cd-route) further down.

You can also skip git and download a package from [Releases](https://github.com/Ashley-QwQ/disc-probe/releases/latest):

- `full-win64`: for Windows, with its own Python and dependencies. Unpack it and double-click `开始 Start.bat`, nothing to install. You can skip the install steps below.
- `core`: disc-probe alone, for a machine that has Python. Unpack it, run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` in the folder, then the `selftest` below.

Open a terminal as administrator, install the dependencies, and check your setup on the simulated drive. If you cannot run as administrator, add `--transport imapi` to the drive commands: it sends the same CDBs through Windows' own IMAPI2 recorder interface (`IDiscRecorder2Ex`), which a standard user may call. The default, `auto`, switches to it when SPTI is refused.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ashley-QwQ/disc-probe
```

```bash
cd disc-probe
```

```bash
python -m pip install numpy pillow scipy
```

```bash
python -m discprobe selftest
```

If you see `No module named discprobe`, you are probably not in the folder yet: run `cd disc-probe` above first. All the commands here run from inside it.

If you're not sure what to run next, run `guide`. It reads the `results` folder, shows which steps are done and where you are, and prints the next command. It doesn't touch the drive. The first time, it offers a walkthrough; `python -m discprobe tutorial` shows it again whenever you like:

```bash
python -m discprobe guide
```

At a terminal, `timing` and `geo` end with a one-line verdict, and each command also ends by printing the next one, ready to copy. Scripts and pipes don't get these. See [Using it by hand](#using-it-by-hand) for the rest.

<img src="docs/showcase/cli_demo_en.gif" width="100%" alt="Terminal recording: the opening disc, next-step hints, the measuring progress line and the games for the wait">

*Recorded on the simulated drive, so this isn't a real measurement. A script presses the games' keys; press `g` while measuring to open one, `n` to change game.*

### Step 1: burn a random-data disc

The measuring disc must hold plain data, since discs with burned patterns often can't be read. Once the image is ready, right-click `iso/random.iso` in Explorer and choose Burn disc image (a double-click only mounts it), and check that the burner is your optical drive.

```bash
python -m discprobe random --output iso/random.iso
```

**A burn can't be undone.** DVD+R, DVD-R and CD-R can't be erased; only RW discs can. The tool doesn't do the burning and can't stop one on the wrong disc, so it flashes a red warning once the image is ready.

### Step 2: check the drive

This takes 1 to 3 minutes. The tray may have opened after the burn, so push it back in and wait a few seconds first. You want to see `CAV` and as little jitter as possible. With only one drive, you can leave out `--drive` at a terminal.

```bash
python -m discprobe timing --drive H:
```

### Step 3: measure the geometry

This takes about 5 minutes. A DVD gets 22 steps, and the progress line at a terminal shows which one it's on.

```bash
python -m discprobe geo --drive H:
```

The pitch on some discs drifts slowly. RITEKF1 is fine with a constant pitch, while `CMC MAG. AM3` and one RITEK DVD+RW needed a quadratic correction (residuals fell from 0.38° and 0.61° to about 0.08°).

When the residual is high, `geo` compares the two models at the end, with no new measurement. If quadratic is clearly better, it asks you to write a correction file and puts `--correction` in the next commands, ready to copy. Otherwise it says this is probably read noise and you can carry on. The command for the correction file looks like this:

```bash
python tools/geo_polyfit.py results/geo-H-... --write-correction correction.json --order quadratic
```

### Step 4: build a picture ISO and burn it to a blank disc from the same batch

`--geo latest` uses your newest real measurement that can be relied on and prints which one it chose; `results --pick` lets you choose by disc and drive, then by precision or date; a result folder or a `summary.json` path works too. Add `--correction correction.json` if you have a correction file. The picture's longer side spans 116 mm (`--diameter-mm` changes it) and it keeps its shape, with the rest left blank. Put the picture in the current folder, or give its full path, in quotes if it has spaces. The tool then samples sectors and compares them byte by byte with the design.

To place the picture first, run `python -m discprobe edit my_picture.png`: arrow keys move it at the terminal, and after saving you replace `--picture my_picture.png` below with `--design my_picture.design.json`.

```bash
python -m discprobe image --geo latest --picture my_picture.png --output iso/picture.iso
```

At a terminal it ends by drawing the disc small and pointing out things like an almost black or white picture, content outside the drawable area or in the middle of the disc, or a low resolution. These are only notes and never stop the image, and their limits aren't yet calibrated on real discs. Check the preview before burning. After the burn, run `guide`: it explains how to look at the disc and what to do about what you see.

To keep working in DiscImageStudio, export a preset. Set `--sectors` to your disc's sector count (`info` on a blank disc prints it, and DiscImageStudio takes the same number; too high a count can make the close fail) and the radius range to what `geo` measured, and add `--correction correction.json` if you have one. The command `geo` prints at the end has these filled in. It prints the conversion error against the measurement, so check that before burning. Add `--install` to write the preset straight into DiscImageStudio's user preset file (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\DiscImageStudio\disc-presets.json`) and pick it from the preset list after restarting DiscImageStudio: the file is backed up first as `disc-presets.json.<date>-<time>.bak`, a new name each time, so the first backup is always the file as it was before any install. Comments and trailing commas in that file are read but not written back, and a simulated run, a run that stopped, or one too noisy to rely on is refused. A field it does not write is kept, but one whose value no longer fits (a `usableSectors` above this disc's sector count, say) is dropped and named in the output, because DiscImageStudio would refuse the whole file over it. Without `--install` you only get the JSON to enter by hand: create a project and fill in the inner and outer radius, sector count and the three pitch terms:

```bash
python -m discprobe disexport --geo latest --sectors YOUR_SECTOR_COUNT --r-min 25.8 --r-max 54.5 --output dis_preset.json
# or write it into DiscImageStudio's preset list (takes effect after a restart):
python -m discprobe disexport --geo latest --sectors YOUR_SECTOR_COUNT --r-min 25.8 --r-max 54.5 --install
```

### Step 5: look at the disc and photograph it

The data side works like a mirror, so your eye or a photo mostly sees what it reflects. Straight on, that's only you, and room lights and bright walls can cover the picture, so a burned image may not show at first glance. The rainbow "pizza slices" are diffraction from the factory groove and aren't part of what you burned. The whole image shows up with a small, bright light right next to your eye or camera.

<img src="docs/showcase/lighting_setup.png" width="80%" alt="Two lighting setups seen from above: a light to one side gives rainbow bands, a small light beside a far camera shows the picture">

1. Turn off the room lights and keep one small light. A phone torch works, or a small white square on a black monitor.
2. Put the light beside the phone, both away from the disc. About 1 m is best, or as far as you can.
3. Tilt the disc slightly so it reflects something dark, not the light. Turn it slowly while watching the screen, and the picture appears when the disc goes dark.
4. After focusing, pull the phone's exposure down a little.
5. Keep what's behind the disc and the phone dark, and keep your hands away from the disc.

We've tried this on DVD. A flatbed scanner also works, since a scan isn't affected by reflections in the room.

### CD route

CD has one more constant that timing can't see, so it takes one more disc for calibration. This is the route we recommend: measure, export a preset, then run fine calibration in [DiscImageStudio](https://github.com/JiaFeiMiao-K-Cat/DiscImageStudio). Grid discs, texture rings and the other ways are in the [manual](docs/MANUAL.en.md#cd-r纹理计时与刻图), which is in Chinese for now.

1. Burn the measuring disc on your first blank. At 8x this took about 11 minutes on a GH70N. The tray opens when the burn ends, and `-Reload` only pulls it back in, without opening it first; on a slim drive, push it in yourself.

   ```bash
   python -m discprobe random --media cd --output iso/cd-random.iso
   ```

   ```bash
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/burn_imapi.ps1 -Drive H: -Iso iso/cd-random.iso -Speed 8 -Burn -Reload
   ```

2. Measure. `timing` takes 1 to 3 minutes and `geo` about 5 minutes for 36 steps. If `timing` says the rotation isn't CAV, change speed as it suggests and use the same speed for `geo`. The `geo` command `timing` prints is shorter and uses the default range, which also works; it's written out here to reach a larger radius.

   ```bash
   python -m discprobe timing --media cd --drive H: --speed 1411
   ```

   ```bash
   python -m discprobe geo --media cd --drive H: --speed 1411 --host-delay-ms 35 --ranges 2000-356000
   ```

3. Export the preset. The `disexport` command `geo` prints at the end has the values filled in, so copy it. Its `--sectors` may only be how much the measuring disc holds, so run `info` on a blank disc and change it if `info` differs. Enter the same number in DiscImageStudio. One user [reported](https://github.com/JiaFeiMiao-K-Cat/DiscImageStudio/discussions/107#discussioncomment-19442161) that its read-from-disc gave too high a count and closing the disc failed, so don't use that number. Add `--install` to write it into DiscImageStudio's user preset file (backed up first as `disc-presets.json.<date>-<time>.bak`, a new name each time; a simulated run, one that stopped, or one too noisy is refused), then pick it from the preset list after a restart.
4. Run fine calibration on your second blank. In DiscImageStudio, choose the preset you just imported (or enter it by hand), choose fine calibration on the assisted calibration page, create a target, burn it, rectify a photo, trace points, solve and apply, then save it as a preset. Its [calibration guide](https://github.com/JiaFeiMiao-K-Cat/DiscImageStudio/blob/main/docs/CALIBRATION.md) has the steps.
5. Burn your picture with those parameters in DiscImageStudio, on your third blank.

## Drives with hands-on reports

This lists drives someone has tested so far, and a drive that isn't listed may still work. Run `timing` to find out. Most of the data comes from `timing`. You can add yours in [DiscImageStudio discussion #107](https://github.com/JiaFeiMiao-K-Cat/DiscImageStudio/discussions/107).

FUA re-reads always take two turns. SET CD SPEED to 4x doesn't change speed. `--sectors 16` recommended | NaiveTomcat, [#107](https://github.com/JiaFeiMiao-K-Cat/DiscImageStudio/discussions/107) |

Jitter when `geo` starts: 307 µs with `--speed 5540`, 82 µs with `--speed 3324 --sectors 16`, 192 µs with `--speed 5540 --sectors 16`, all at the same rpm, so 3324 is better on this drive. `--speed 5540 --reps 32` finishes, but with rms 2.68° and about 1.7° uncertainty, and 28.9 to 32.7 mm jumps from +5° to −8°. `--speed 3324 --sectors 16` stopped after a 10° miss at LBA 358368 (about 31.8 mm). The same stretch failing twice doesn't look like random noise; the cause wasn't found and there was no reburn to compare. Skipping it with `--ranges 450000-1950000` [finishes](https://github.com/JiaFeiMiao-K-Cat/DiscImageStudio/discussions/107#discussioncomment-19444762), covering 34.22 to 54.39 mm with 0.59° uncertainty, rms 1.54° and chi2/dof 4.9, and LBA 1949984 is still 3° off. In 34 to 54 mm that is about 0.2° rms from FanJZSS's GP65NB60 result on the same kind of disc, within the uncertainty.. Later `--speed 3324 --sectors 16` ran the whole 25.6 to 54.4 mm: rms 0.54 to 0.63°, chi2/dof 4.2 to 5.0, about 1.4 to 1.5 with a quadratic correction, and a book under the drive made no difference beyond noise ([#107](https://github.com/JiaFeiMiao-K-Cat/DiscImageStudio/discussions/107#discussioncomment-19454690)) | Doctor-shengru, [#107](https://github.com/JiaFeiMiao-K-Cat/DiscImageStudio/discussions/107#discussioncomment-19444762) |

The preset went straight into DIS with no further calibration; cross lines came out straight and perpendicular (by eye, no measured error), and a finished picture was burned too. Photo calibration had never worked before With calibration data from Lakida0 (2295104 sectors) [the disc closed normally](https://github.com/JiaFeiMiao-K-Cat/DiscImageStudio/discussions/107#discussioncomment-19440415); 4x was set but it burned at 2x throughout, and the grid and text came out clear (user report). On BD-R (MID `RITEK (000)`, reported as BD-ROM) it reads at constant linear velocity, so [`timing` finds no CAV](https://github.com/JiaFeiMiao-K-Cat/DiscImageStudio/discussions/107#discussioncomment-19440933): about 1.6x by default or at 3324, about 2.1x at 8990 and 26974, and `--cav` has no effect. Ritek mini DVD-R (`RITEKG04`): a 700000-sector measuring disc, `geo` covering 24.44 to 36.02 mm, and a 713936-sector preset in DIS [burned a picture](https://github.com/JiaFeiMiao-K-Cat/DiscImageStudio/discussions/107#discussioncomment-19442161) at 2x, with the vertical line and F slightly bent and very small text readable (user report). The same drive on Ritek e-series DVD-R (`RITEKF1`): `geo` 22 steps, rms 0.219°, chi2/dof 1.34, [about 0.1° rms from the RiDATA preset](https://github.com/JiaFeiMiao-K-Cat/DiscImageStudio/discussions/107#discussioncomment-19442592) (about 0.35° peak to peak) and about 0.07° rms from the GH70N here, all within the uncertainty. A preset refitted with `disexport --sectors 2297888` on RiDATA (`RITEKF1`) [closed normally](https://github.com/JiaFeiMiao-K-Cat/DiscImageStudio/issues/183#issuecomment-6690200194), at an actual 4x with a normal picture (user report, one disc, drive not stated). The 608 sectors fewer than 2298496 are overhead for closing the disc (TBO 592 plus BSGA 16), as [the DIS author explains](https://github.com/JiaFeiMiao-K-Cat/DiscImageStudio/issues/183#issuecomment-6691519009). | domerawind, [#107](https://github.com/JiaFeiMiao-K-Cat/DiscImageStudio/discussions/107#discussioncomment-19421274) |

Phases at 1432 and 2355 rpm agree within 0.17°. At 3596 rpm they differ by up to +0.97° near 52 mm. A disc with a burned calibration pattern couldn't be read, so use random data. `geo` finished 22 steps (`--speed 3324`) with rms 0.61° and chi2/dof 10.8 at constant pitch, and 0.078° and 0.20 at quadratic pitch, so the pitch on this disc drifts slowly and needs a correction. A calibration pattern burned at 2.4x with the corrected preset shows radial lines only slightly off by eye, after a dozen manual attempts before just to see them With a CD-RW (AnyBurn 10x): `disexport --along-track-frames -100` is about 2 frames from DIS fine calibration, and the radial lines look straight (user report). Both show a step of about 0.2 mm near 33 to 34 mm (rough, from photos). Later, `--speed 3324 --ranges 10000-2290000` stopped in the inner area (fit error ratio 27). With `--chi2-abort 100` it finished 22 steps covering 24.20 to 58.09 mm, with rms 0.951° and chi2/dof 26.2 at constant pitch, and 0.092° and 0.27 at quadratic.

Constant pitch gives rms 0.38° and quadratic pitch 0.087°, so the pitch on this disc drifts slowly. The user's [follow-up](https://github.com/JiaFeiMiao-K-Cat/DiscImageStudio/discussions/107#discussioncomment-19410771) reports a clear picture from the constant-pitch preset, even at the drive's maximum 8x write speed (photo to come, no quantitative image-error measurement yet).

Against the geometry of the same batch as [#53](https://github.com/JiaFeiMiao-K-Cat/DiscImageStudio/issues/53), it is off by about 9.5° peak to peak over 27 to 54 mm (+7.7° at 54 mm), which fits a completion-time jump of about 0.2 ms past 50 mm bczhc's [report](https://gist.github.com/bczhc/0323c1762b0d47a46b59159a83353703): `SET CD SPEED` is accepted but the speed doesn't change, and `SET STREAMING` is rejected (5/24/00). DVD-RW stays at about 4840 rpm with 4.8–7.0° jitter. Teardown posts say it's a Pioneer BDR-209 (not readable over SCSI, not measured). Use another drive to measure; it can still burn.

bczhc ported the tool to Linux: [bczhc/disc-probe](https://github.com/bczhc/disc-probe) (see its `README-linux.md`). NaiveTomcat ported it to macOS: [NaiveTomcat/discprobe-macos](https://github.com/NaiveTomcat/discprobe-macos) (GPL-3.0-or-later). The release includes a signed, notarized universal helper, so you don't need to compile anything.

## Using it by hand

<details>
<summary>Walkthrough, next-step hints, drive letters, result paths, common options, Tab completion, language, games and local files</summary>

The hints, progress and animation below only appear when stdout is a terminal. Pipes, redirects and scripts get essentially the same output as before, and result files keep their format. To turn them off in a terminal, set `DISCPROBE_PLAIN=1`.

- Walkthrough: The first `guide` offers one: Enter or `y` shows it, `n` skips it, and it only asks once. Someone with real results already isn't asked. `python -m discprobe tutorial` shows it any time.
- What to run next: `guide` shows which steps are done and prints the next command, without touching the drive. Running `python -m discprobe` with no arguments does the same. Once there's a picture ISO, it also explains how to look at the disc and what to do about what you see. `info`, `timing`, `geo`, `random`, `image` and `disexport` also end with the next command, and `timing`, `geo`, `random` and `image` list your progress before it. `timing` adds a verdict: try another speed if it isn't CAV or above about 2° of jitter, and above about 5° the drive is probably not suitable. These limits come from the reports table and aren't exact. A `geo` that stops gets advice based on why it stopped. One that finishes with more than noise left (chi²/dof above 2) compares a constant and a quadratic pitch after closing the drive: if quadratic at least halves chi²/dof, it asks for a correction file and the next commands use it; otherwise it says this is probably read noise and you can carry on.
- Drive letter: `list` shows the drives. At a terminal you can leave out `--drive`: with one drive it's used, with several you're asked.
- Result paths: `--geo` also takes a result folder, `pick` to choose, or `latest`, which skips simulated runs and runs that stopped early. Results now say when they stopped early; older ones can only be judged by under 8 rungs or chi²/dof above 25, so one that stopped after 8 rungs can't be told apart. `results geo` lists past runs, and `results geo --latest` prints one folder for scripts.
- `--sectors` means three things: In `timing` and `geo` it's sectors per read; `16` reads a whole DVD ECC block. In `random` it's how much to burn. In `disexport` it's the disc's capacity, and DiscImageStudio takes the same number. `info` prints a value and where it came from; go by the one from a blank disc.
- `--speed` takes kB/s or a multiple like `4x`, counted from the 1x of `--media`. DVD: `2.4x` = 3324, `4x` = 5540 (the `geo` default), `8x` = 11080. CD: `8x` = 1411 (the default), `16x` = 2822, `24x` = 4234. Lower is usually quieter, but not every drive changes speed, so check the rpm that `timing` prints.
- `--ranges` takes LBA ranges `a-b,c-d`. The default, 3–85 % of the recorded area, suits most discs. Leave out an area where `geo` keeps stopping or where the speed jumps. Widen it for more radius if the drive reads that far cleanly; on a GP65NB60 that removed the outer error. `info` shows the last LBA.
- CD and DVD: The steps are the same, with `--media cd` on each command. At a terminal, a CD with DVD settings gets a question first, and an empty tray is reported straight away. `disexport` follows the `--geo` result, so its `--media` is only a check.
- When something goes wrong part way: If the tray opens or the disc is taken out or changed during a measurement, `timing` and `geo` stop at once, say why and exit with code 1. What was measured is kept and marked as stopped early, and `--geo latest` won't use it. If an ISO write is interrupted, the unfinished file is removed; where nothing could clean up, such as a closed window, `guide` still won't take it for finished.
- Tab completion: `python -m discprobe completion install` sets it up for PowerShell, bash or zsh: it writes a script to your home folder and adds one line to your shell's startup file, and `completion uninstall` takes both out. The current window doesn't have it until you open a new one or run the line it prints. In PowerShell, Tab on a `discprobe` line opens a list with what each option takes; elsewhere Tab is unchanged. Pressing Tab never starts Python, because the commands and options are written into the script, so install again after an update. Other `python` commands still complete paths, but in bash and zsh it replaces any completion those shells had for `python`.
- Language: At a terminal it follows the system, so a Chinese system gets Chinese help, hints and measuring output. Choose with `--lang zh` or `--lang en` anywhere on the command, or `DISCPROBE_LANG=zh`. Pipes, redirects and `DISCPROBE_PLAIN=1` stay English and ignore `DISCPROBE_LANG`; only `--lang` on the command itself changes them. Result files are never translated.
- Progress: `timing` and `geo` show a bar, the current stage, the time spent and the time left. A narrow window drops parts instead of wrapping. ISO writers use the same line, following the file's real size. Ctrl+C keeps what was measured and says where it is. In Windows Terminal and other terminals that support it, the tab and the taskbar button show the progress too. In a wide window the `timing` and `geo` line also has a small graph of the last 12 read times.
- Measured lines: At a terminal, the Zone and Target lines of `timing` are aligned in columns. Pipes and scripts get the same bytes as before.
- Games: While measuring, press `g` to open one under the progress line, `n` for the next and `q` to close it. Snake: arrows or WASD steer, `r` plays again. Fill the Disc: blocks fly in from the right and stack on the left, up and down move them, right spins, left drops, and a full column clears. Merge Sectors: arrows slide, equal blocks merge and double (`2K`, `4K` and so on), and the board carries over to your next wait. Sudoku: arrows move, digits fill in, `0` or space clears. With 30 s to 2 minutes left when it first comes up it's 4×4, with more it's 6×6 (2×3 boxes), and under 30 s there's none. Measuring output keeps printing above them. They don't exist until you press `g`, and never appear in pipes, with `DISCPROBE_PLAIN=1` or with `--no-animation`.
- Local files: Besides `results` and the images you make, the tool writes two small files in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\disc-probe\` (`~/.local/state/disc-probe/` elsewhere): `games.json` holds the Merge Sectors board, written only when the progress line closes, and `tutorial_offered` remembers that the walkthrough was offered. Tab completion's own files are described above. All of these are safe to delete.

The progress line and the games have no background thread, because one could delay the completion timestamps. They're drawn on the main thread during the random pause before each timed read, and the drawing time comes off that pause. On the simulated drive, the same seed gives identical summaries and events with or without them. The games work the same way: keys, moves and drawing all happen in that pause, only changed cells are drawn, and each has its own random generator. On the simulated drive, playing all four also leaves summaries and events identical. The animation still draws at most 8 frames a second, like the earlier progress line, though a colour frame writes more bytes. `timing` was compared with that earlier line on a real drive: the difference with and without it (0.01–0.20°) matched the difference between repeats (0.02–0.23°). The new animation, the games and `geo` haven't been compared yet, so add `--no-animation` or use a pipe if you want to rule them out, and don't play during a measurement that matters.

`timing` and `geo` raise the process to high priority while measuring. Before 2026-11-06 this always failed on 64-bit Python, so earlier real measurements on 64-bit Python ran at normal priority, including the comparison above. Reports made with this tool on Windows probably did too; ports and other probes may differ. The effect of high priority on jitter hasn't been compared yet.

The opening screen of `guide` is a disc catching the light. Windows Terminal, Ghostty, WezTerm, kitty and the Claude desktop app's terminal draw block characters themselves, so there it's a disc of half-block pixels, dyed further out as the steps get done, with a line-style progress bar (UTF-8 needed). It falls back from that to true colour to 16 colours to plain text, and a small window gets the title alone. The turning disc on the progress line is decoration, not the real speed. Other terminals, such as Windows' old console window, get 7-bit ASCII by default, so no code page or font can break it; `DISCPROBE_UNICODE=1` asks for finer glyphs by hand. `NO_COLOR` turns off colour only; `--no-animation`, `DISCPROBE_NO_ANIMATION=1` and `CI` turn off animation. Details are in the [manual](docs/MANUAL.en.md#手动使用) (in Chinese).

## Another way to use it: timing plus fine calibration

If the timing result isn't perfect, you can use it just to get close, then finish with the image method in DiscImageStudio. pugod124 had failed on about 15 CDs and got clean images this way. See [disc-probe #2](https://github.com/Ashley-QwQ/disc-probe/issues/2#issuecomment-6650565706).

<img src="docs/showcase/pugod124_cd.jpg" width="60%" alt="pugod124's CD-R, burned after geo and then fine calibration in DiscImageStudio">

*A Memorex CD-R burned this way by pugod124, cropped to the disc.*

## Limitations

Discs with the same MID can still differ: two `CMC MAG. AM3` discs differ by about 0.7% in track pitch. Someone else's preset may not fit, so measure your own batch.

Drives vary a lot. A drive that isn't CAV, or has a lot of jitter (200 µs, for example), may give a geometry you can't use, so run `timing` first.

Fast reads near the outer edge can mislead. At 3226 rpm the GH70N finishes CD reads about 0.2 ms late past 49.8 mm, which looks like a change in geometry. The effect is gone at lower speed.

So far we have only burned pictures ourselves on the GH70N. Results for other drives come from timing comparisons and burns by a few users.

On CD, the along-track constant has to come from a grid disc, and 206 frames only applies to the GH70N with an IMAPI burn and READ(12) reads. CMC CD-R also drops about 0.4° near 33 mm, possibly a seam from burning, which we are still checking.

`geo` supports DVD and CD only. Blu-ray discs can only run `timing`.

## Safety

The drive code only sends read commands. A whitelist in [`discprobe/scsi.py`](discprobe/scsi.py) rejects any other opcode before it reaches the device, and the self-test confirms that WRITE, CLOSE TRACK and FORMAT UNIT are refused. The one command that changes drive state is `SET CD SPEED`, sent only if you pass `--speed` or `--cav`. Burning is left to Windows' own burning components, and [`tools/burn_imapi.ps1`](tools/burn_imapi.ps1) only writes when given `-Burn`.

## Prior work and thanks

Measuring sector angles from read timing didn't start here:

- Data Position Measurement (DPM) in disc copy protection, used by SecuROM 4 and later.
- A 2025 discussion on the redump forum about timing a full turn by re-reading one sector with FUA.
- Philips patent US7538787B2 on writing labels on optical discs (priority 2002, lapsed 2017), which describes the same idea for burning visible labels in the data area: timestamps at the end of ECC blocks, repeated reads for the rotation period, and jump distances doubling each round.

This repository adds an open source implementation that can be reproduced on ordinary consumer drives and handles the problems real drives have. It uses covariance-driven stepwise measurement with uncertainty estimates, checks results on burned grid discs, carries corrections across discs, and exports DiscImageStudio presets.

The data-side encoding follows [DiscImageStudio](https://github.com/JiaFeiMiao-K-Cat/DiscImageStudio), and `discprobe/efmplus.py` is ported from it. Thanks to NaiveTomcat and bczhc for the ports, and to anyezhixie, bczhc, Disappear9, domerawind, FanJZSS, kasumikira, Lakida0, li-yifei, MasterMT9, moodyos, NaiveTomcat, NO-ob, pugod124, ShiroiTree, Sliicy, WindowsNoEditor and zhajial for their reports.
