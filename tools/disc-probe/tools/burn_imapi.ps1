<#
Burn an ISO image with Windows' own IMAPI2 at a chosen write speed (isoburn.exe cannot set one).

Without -Burn it only reports the recorder, the media, its blank state and the supported write
speeds, and writes nothing. With -Burn it writes the image as one closed session at the
nearest speed the drive lists.

  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\burn_imapi.ps1 -Drive H: -Iso iso\x.iso
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\burn_imapi.ps1 -Drive H: -Iso iso\x.iso -Speed 8 -Burn

-Speed is in multiples of the medium's 1x (CD 75 sectors/s, DVD 675 sectors/s).
Windows' read-back check after the burn is turned off, as DiscImageStudio does. Picture data can be
slow or hard to read back, and a failed check reports the whole burn as failed after the data is
already on the disc. -Verify keeps Windows' default check.

-KeepOpen leaves the disc open after this session, so another can be added later. -Append adds a
session to such a disc; it needs -ExpectStart with the LBA the image was made for (`image --start-lba`,
from the next writable address `info` prints), and refuses if the drive would write anywhere else.

-Reload closes the tray again after the eject (tray-loading drives such as the GH70N), so the
burned disc can be read straight away. Without it, push the tray back in before measuring.

While writing it prints a line every 30 s with an estimate from the write speed. That estimate
is time only: IMAPI2's progress events would have to run inside the burn, and a burn can't be
retried on the same disc, so this stays out of the way of the write.

If Write fails, the script says whether that came before or after the time the data should have
taken, and gives the error code. IMAPI2 often reports only E_FAIL, with no reason.

Closing a CD needs some room beyond FreeSectorsOnMedia: on a 359,847-sector CD-R a 359,800-sector
image was refused at the start of Write ("stream too large"), 359,600 sectors went through.
